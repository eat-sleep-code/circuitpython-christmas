# A Very Merry CircuitPython Christmas 

This is a Christmas version of the [Screaming Halloween Cauldrons](https://eat-sleep-code.com/blog/screaming-halloween-cauldrons).   

Feel free to use it in your Christmas decor.   Some simple ideas are to play a jingle when someone approaches your door or opens your mailbox.

You will need at least one Sharp proximity sensors, at least one [Trinket M0s](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500), and an [AudioFX board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2220), and a speaker (along with the files contained in this repository). 


Merry Christmas!
