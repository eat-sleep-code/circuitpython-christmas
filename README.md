# A Very Merry CircuitPython Christmas 

This is a Christmas version of the [Screaming Halloween Cauldrons](https://eat-sleep-code.com/blog/screaming-halloween-cauldrons).   

Feel free to use it in your Christmas decor.   Some simple ideas are to play a jingle when someone approaches your door or opens your mailbox.

Merry Christmas!
